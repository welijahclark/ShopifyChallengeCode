#Declaring variables and obtaining the mean

> mean(orderamount)
[1] 3145.128

#This is how the original Average Order Value (AOV) of $3145.13 would have been obtained. While it isn't necessarily wrong, it is very simple. 
#We could either do some basic manipulation of the data or do some data cleaning to come up with a better metric for AOV.

#Method 1: Arithmetic Approach

#Declaring more variables and re-arranging a different mean
> totalitems <- X2019_Winter_Data_Science_Intern_Challenge_Data_Set_Sheet1$total_items
> individualorderaverage <- orderamount/totalitems
> mean(individualorderaverage)
[1] 387.7428

#387.7428 is better, but still seems somewhat unrealistic for sneakers. We can also check to see if the data is right skewed with the median.

> median(individualorderaverage)
[1] 153

# With a median of $153, the data is very likely skewed to the right. However, this seems low and may undercount orders with multiple pairs of sneakers.
# From here, let's try the data cleaning method.

#Method 2: Outlier Replace Funtionality + Recalculating

library(data.table)
outlierReplace = function(dataframe, cols, rows, newValue = NA) {
    if (any(rows)) {
        set(dataframe, rows, cols, newValue)
    }
}
> outlierReplace(X2019_Winter_Data_Science_Intern_Challenge_Data_Set_Sheet1, "order_amount", which(X2019_Winter_Data_Science_Intern_Challenge_Data_Set_Sheet1$order_amount > 1000), NA)
> mean(na.omit(orderamount))
[1] 301.0643

#$301.0643 is even better, but it is still possible that the data is skewed due to the presence of some more expensive models of sneakers. 
#We can check the median as well to see if this is the case.

> median(na.omit(orderamount))
[1] 284

##########
# Part C #
##########

#With $284 as our median and as a more realistic AOV, we can note that the distribution of our orders is right skewed based on the previous mean of $301.06.
#Thus, it would be more realistic to say that $284 serves as a better metric for AOV.
